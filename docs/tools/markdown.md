## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code`.

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with ```:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

```c++
for(int i=0; i<3; ++i)
  printf('%d\n', i);
```

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: This is the footnote.
[^2]:
    Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
    This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.

[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
